--All scenarios are based on Database NORTHWND.
--1.	List all cities that have both Employees and Customers.

		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Employees
		WHERE City IN
		(SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers)
		

--2.	List all cities that have Customers but no Employee.
--a.	Use sub-query

		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers
		WHERE City NOT IN
		(SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Employees)

--b.	Do not use sub-query

		SELECT c.City
		FROM dbo.Customers c
		EXCEPT
		SELECT e.City
		FROM dbo.Employees e

--3.	List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.

		SELECT ProductName, UnitsOnOrder FROM dbo.Products

--4.	List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.

		SELECT ShipCity, COUNT(OrderID) AS "TotalProducts_EachCity"
		FROM dbo.Orders
		WHERE ShipCity IN
		(SELECT City 
		FROM dbo.Customers)
		GROUP BY (ShipCity)


--5.	List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.
--a.	Use union

		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers
		GROUP BY (City)
		HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) >=2
		UNION ALL
		SELECT ShipCity
		FROM dbo.Orders
		GROUP BY (ShipCity)
		HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) >=2


--b.	Use sub-query and no union

		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers
		GROUP BY (City)
		HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) >=2


--6.	List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least two different kinds of products.
		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers
		GROUP BY (City)
		HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) >=2


--7.	List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.
		SELECT CustomerID
		FROM dbo.Customers
		WHERE City 
		NOT IN (SELECT ShipCity
		FROM dbo.Orders)

		
--8.	List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.
		SELECT TOP 5 ProductName FROM dbo.Products
		ORDER BY (ReorderLevel)

--9.	List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.
--a.	Use sub-query
		SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Employees
		WHERE City NOT IN
		(SELECT City
		FROM dbo.Customers)

--b.	Do not use sub-query
		
		SELECT e.City
		FROM dbo.Employees e
		EXCEPT
		SELECT c.City
		FROM dbo.Customers c
		
--10.	List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, 
-- and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)
		SELECT TOP 1 ShipCity FROM dbo.Orders
		GROUP BY ShipCity


--11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
	SELECT * FROM TABLE
	GROUP BY id


--12. Sample table to be used for solutions below- Employee ( empid integer, mgrid integer, deptid integer, salary integer) 
-- Dept (deptid integer, deptname text)
-- Find employees who do not manage anybody.

	SELECT EmployeeID FROM dbo.Employees
	WHERE ReportsTo IS NULL


--13. Find departments that have maximum number of employees. (solution should consider scenario having more than 1 departments that have maximum number of employees). Result should only have - deptname, count of employees sorted by deptname.
	SELECT TOP 1 ReportsTo FROM dbo.Employees

--14. Find top 3 employees (salary based) in every department. Result should have deptname, empid, salary sorted by deptname and then employee with high to low salary.
	SELECT TOP 3 EmployeeID, Deptname, Empid, Salary FROM dbo.Employees
	ORDER BY Salary
